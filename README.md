### Travel Globe Concept
  * `Snippets4Fun/Travel_Globe/` â€” cinematic React Three Fiber travel experience rendered in the browser with a premium Wanderlust Luxe aesthetic.
    * Features a physically-lit Earth with day/night texture swaps, emissive nightlife glow, cloud parallax, and bloom-enhanced post-processing.
    * React-based UI overlay provides glassmorphism cards, featured journeys, and interactive destination markers that orbit with the globe while OrbitControls keeps movement smooth.
* Boot with `npm install` + `npm run dev` inside the `Travel_Globe` folder (customize `src/config/textureSources.js` if you want to point at self-hosted 2K NASA textures) to explore the fully interactive concept.
