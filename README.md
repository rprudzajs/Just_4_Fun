### Travel Globe Concept
* `Snippets4Fun/Travel_Globe/` â€” cinematic React Three Fiber travel experience rendered in the browser with a premium Wanderlust Luxe aesthetic.
  * Includes a custom shader-driven Earth with day/night texture blending, specular glints, an additive atmosphere shell, and bloom-enhanced post-processing.
  * React-based UI overlay provides glassmorphism cards, featured journeys, and interactive destination markers synced with smooth camera flyovers.
* Boot with `npm install` + `npm run dev` inside the `Travel_Globe` folder (customize `src/config/textureSources.js` if you want to point at self-hosted 2K NASA textures) to explore the fully interactive concept.
