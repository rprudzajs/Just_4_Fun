# Wanderworld Luxe Globe (React Three Fiber)

A cinematic WebGL travel hero built with React Three Fiber, Drei, Postprocessing, and TailwindCSS. The experience mirrors luxury travel inspiration sites with a glassmorphism UI, soft bloom, and custom-shaded Earth.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd Snippets4Fun/Travel_Globe
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on Vite and opens automatically on `http://localhost:5173`.

## High-Resolution Textures

The globe boots with procedural fallbacks while it streams premium textures from the [pmndrs/drei-assets](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei-assets) CDN. If you prefer to ship your own 2K NASA maps, update the URLs inside `src/config/textureSources.js` or replace them with local imports following the same keys:

- `day`
- `night`
- `normal`
- `specular`
